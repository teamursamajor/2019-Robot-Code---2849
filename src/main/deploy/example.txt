Files placed in this directory will be deployed to the RoboRIO into the
'deploy' directory in the home folder. Use the 'FileUtilities.getFilePath' wpilib function
to get a proper path relative to the deploy directory.

We can place auto files in this directory so we don't have to use WinSCP anymore! -20XX
