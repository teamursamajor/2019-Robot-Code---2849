Test distance sensor
Test and finalize climber
New Hatch code
Potentional Hatch automation/limelightQ
Clean up/update teleopPeriodic() and control map code to reflect robot
Mount second drive encoder


Finish Auto Selector and test it
Write auto files/draw paths
Automate cargo using encoders or color sensor

Color Sensor:
	Where should we mount them? One in the center of the robot could be used to automate cargo drop off maybe
	We could also put one on the hatch end of the robot (centered horizontally on the edge)
	Wire and mount the second sensor
		Have build start to figure out how to mount them properly (NOT duct tape)
	Write the code for the second one (should be easy, just make another object). Make sure that both can work at the same time
	Add another DriveMode which drives forward until the color sensor gets a match

Drive Encoders

Color sensor code for cargo (come at the line at an angle, kill motors/start turning, drive forward and drop off)
Write auto code for all 3 rows:
	Far Hatch -> Mid Hatch for both sides
	Mid Hatch -> Close Cargo for both sides
	Front Hatch/Cargo -> ?
	Default drive forward mode

Testing:
	Test new cargo mode progression
		X should go from ground to rocket and back
		Y should go from ground to bay and back
	New cargo velocity
		Does it still return infinity/NaN?
		If not try adding a kD constant and see what happens
			Then tune it

	Test limelight turntable movement

Camera Mount: In progress but check on it

Lower Priority:
	Constants:
		Move more powers and stuff to constants
	Add offset to potentiometers? Ex: Cargo pot starts from around 125-130, adding an offset would make it stop from 0

Older To Do Lists:
Add Logger calls throughout the code
	Later, if we have extra time, we can improve the Logger functionality

Look at all the TODO's in the project and start doing them:
	We never get to this. Maybe this year it'll be different...
	
Auto:
	-Write new auto code:
		-Make new path files
		-Take a ball or hatch to any spot on the bay
			-Dont drop the hatch until the driver confirms the position
			-New naming convention:
				[L,M,R][1,2][Hatch || Cargo][L,M,R][1,2][Additional Actions].auto
				Ex: L1HatchL1LoadingStation.auto
					Start on level 1 from the left, dropping off hatch at L1 station, then move to loading station afterward
		-5 Start Positions:
			Level 2: L   R
			Level 1: L M R
	-SmartDashboard integration
	-Improve scripting language
