Robotics To Do:
-Update cargo voltages
-Test the feed forward to determine the empirically found motor factor
-Tune the PID loop
-Increment kp until you find kc (or approx. kc)

-test auto align

	On real bot:
	Get voltage on ground and at 90 degrees to redo the regression
	Get the voltages for the different heights
	Double check feed forward and the empirically found factor
	Test PID loop moving to different heights

-Camera mount
	Determine limelight mounting height
	Make perfboard extension from eboard for cargo camera

-General code clean up:
	Finish To Dos
	Remove unneeded comments and unused code

-Auto code:
	Finish PathFinding software and AutoSelector
	Can we drive a path backwards?
    Level 1/2 -> Cargo on side -> Pick up cargo -> Side cargo
							   -> Pick up hatch -> Rocket
							                    -> Front bay
							   
			  -> Hatch in front -> Pick up cargo -> Side cargo
			  
			  -> Hatch in front -> Pick up hatch -> Rocket
												 -> Second front hatch
			  -> Hatch on side -> Pick up hatch -> Rocket
												-> Front hatch
							   -> Pick up cargo -> Side cargo
	Need Paths for:
		Level 1/2 -> Close side bay
		Close side bay -> Cargo pick up
		Cargo pick up -> Close side bay
		Close side bay -> Loading station
		Loading station -> Rocket
		Loading station -> Front bay
		Level 1/2 -> Front bay
		Front bay -> Cargo pick up
		Front bay -> Loading station
		Cargo pick up -> Middle side bay

-Auto align cargo/hatch using 614 strategy:
	Back up so you're approximately perpendicular to the wall
	Slight drive forward while looping turn PID using limelight
		If its to the left then more power to right, if its to the right then more power to left
			Rumble when auto align is done so nico can shoot immediately
			This also means it doesnt auto shoot so if defense hits us we don't lose a cycle


Finish Auto Selector and test it
Write auto files/draw paths

Camera Mount: In progress but check on it

Older To Do Lists:
Add Logger calls throughout the code
	Later, if we have extra time, we can improve the Logger functionality

Look at all the TODO's in the project and start doing them:
	We never get to this. Maybe this year it'll be different...
	
Auto:
	-Write new auto code:
		-Make new path files
		-Take a ball or hatch to any spot on the bay
			-Dont drop the hatch until the driver confirms the position
			-New naming convention:
				[L,M,R][1,2][Hatch || Cargo][L,M,R][1,2][Additional Actions].auto
				Ex: L1HatchL1LoadingStation.auto
					Start on level 1 from the left, dropping off hatch at L1 station, then move to loading station afterward
		-5 Start Positions:
			Level 2: L   R
			Level 1: L M R
	-SmartDashboard integration
	-Improve scripting language
